Manually implementing the backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer network, but can quickly get very messy for large complex networks.\n","\n","Thankfully, We learned in the reciation that we can use **automatic differentiation** to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The autograd package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a computational graph. Nodes in the graph will be Tensors,\n","and edges will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.\n","\n","If we want to compute gradients with respect to some Tensor, then we set `requires_grad=True` when constructing that Tensor. Any PyTorch operations on that Tensor will cause a computational graph to be constructed, allowing us to later perform backpropagation through the graph. If `x` is a Tensor with `requires_grad=True`, then after backpropagation `x.grad` will be another Tensor holding the gradient of `x`.\n","\n","Sometimes you may wish to prevent PyTorch from building computational graphs when performing certain operations on Tensors with `requires_grad=True`; for example, we usually don't want to backpropagate through the weight update steps when evaluating a neural network. In such scenarios we can use the `torch.no_grad()` context manager to prevent the construction of a computational graph.\n","\n","## In this exercise, you will accomplish the following:\n","1.

To babysit the learning process, **you must track the classification accuracy, IoU score and loss on the training and validation datasets and visualize them** (using matplotlib or similar). I have included an implementation of the IoU metric in the file `data_hw3\\dataloader.py`.\n","3. Do not perform a massive grid search!!\n","4. Use papers, blogs, MOOCs and online guides to research best hyper-parameters for your model.\n","5. You are encouraged to try Google Colab. If you have an CUDA capable GPU at home - you are welcome to use it.\n","5. **Include only your chosen architecture**. During experimentation, you may add as many cells as you need. Make sure to delete them before submission.\n","6. Training large neural networks may take a while. Make sure your code runs reasonably fast (~15 minutes on CPU and ~5 minutes on GPU).\n","7. Try to reach at least 90% classification accuracy and a IOU score of at least 0.60 on the validation set.\n","8. **In order to get full marks for this section explain the results and include visualizations.**.\n","9. You are given a general skeleton for the training function. Feel free to use any different structure.\n","\n","**(30 Points)**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gTx01ImQ0pn7"},"outputs":[],"source":["def train_model(model, criterion_cls, criterion_bbox, optimizer, scheduler=None, num_epochs=5):\n","    since = time.time()\n","    best_model_wts = copy.deepcopy(model.state_dict()) # this is how a model is copied\n","    best_acc = 0.0\n","\n","    # added - track metrics\n","    history = {\n","        'train_loss': [], 'val_loss': [],\n","        'train_acc': [], 'val_acc': [],\n","        'train_iou': [], 'val_iou': []\n","    }\n","\n","    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n","        print('Epoch {}/{}'.format(epoch+1, num_epochs))\n","        print('-' * 10)\n","\n","        # Each epoch has a training and validation phase\n","        for phase in ['train', 'val']:\n","            if phase == 'train':\n","                model.train()  # Set model to training mode\n","            else:\n","                model.eval()   # Set model to evaluate mode\n","\n","            running_loss = 0.0   # total loss of the network at each epoch\n","            running_corrects = 0 # number of correct predictions\n","            iou = 0.0            # IoU score\n","\n","            # Iterate over data.\n","            for sample in dataloaders[phase]:\n","                #############################################################################\n","                # TO DO:                                                                    #\n","                # Extract the data from the dataloader, calculate the predictions of your   #\n","                # network and calculate the loss of the classification and bounding box     #\n","                # prediction.
